## Phonebook

Construct a command-line phonebook tool; timed exercise.

### To install and use

[Pending.]

### Old versions

 1. `phonebook_01.py`: skeleton code, functions exist and report when they are called.
 1. `phonebook_02.py`: `create` working correctly and reports on creation.
 1. `phonebook_03.py`: `add` working correctly; reports on adding name or on duplicate name.
 1. `phonebook_04.py`: `lookup` (simple) working correctly; reports all found names (including any substring) or on name not found.
 1. `phonebook_05.py`: `reverse` working correctly; reports all found numbers (including any substring) or on number not found.
 1. `phonebook_06.py`: `change` working correctly; makes change and then calls `lookup` on name â€” this conveniently lets us know if name was not found, though substring results from `lookup`.

### To do

 1. Default argument to `lookup` allow control of substring search - for use when calling `lookup` from within `change` we don't want substring search.
